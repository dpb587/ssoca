# Release v0.9.0

Features

 * Automatically validate the connection and CA certificate to an environment when configuring it, and show confirmation to the user
 * Automatically prefix environment URLs with `https://` if it is not already specified for slightly shorter commands
 * Show slightly more descriptive HTTP error messages when requests fail (e.g. show `403 Forbidden` instead of `403`)
 * Rename `env add` to `env set` to clarify it can be used for updating settings as well (`env add` currently remains as an alias)
 * Rename `env info` to `env services`, and add `env info` for showing the environment name, URL, and banner
 * The `auth info` command now supports additional options to show only specific pieces of data (i.e. `--authenticated`, `--id`, `--groups`)
 * The `auth info` command now exits with an error if the user is not authenticated

Bug Fixes

 * Fix `or` authorization filter to error with specific error type (avoids generic `500` internal server errors and enables automatic re-login attempts)
