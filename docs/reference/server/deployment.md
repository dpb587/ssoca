# Deployment


## BOSH

Currently, the easiest way to operate ssoca is with [BOSH](https://bosh.io/) using the [ssoca](https://github.com/dpb587/ssoca-bosh-release) release. Review the documentation in that repository. If you're looking to get started, see [dpb587/ssoca-starter-bosh-deployment](https://github.com/dpb587/ssoca-starter-bosh-deployment) for some default conventions.


## Standalone

Alternatively, run `ssoca-server` and provide a path to the YAML server configuration file.
