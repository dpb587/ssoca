# Authorization

Global (`auth.require`) and service-specific (`services[*].require`) authorization restrictions may be configured. For both settings, the values should be an array of hashes with one of the available filter types.

**By default, services are accessible.**


## `and`

Require multiple filters to be true. The array valuesÂ of the node must include one or more additional filters.

    - and:
      - scope: { present: acme/prod-team }
      - scope: { present: acme/security }


## `authenticated`

Require that the user has been successfully authenticated. This filter has no options.

    - authenticated: ~


## `or`

Require at least one of multiple filters to be true. The array values of the node must include one or more additional filters.

    - or:
      - remote_ip: { within: "192.0.2.0/24" }
      - remote_ip: { within: "198.51.100.0/24" }


## `remote_ip`

Require that the current API request has come from a specific IP or CIDR.

    - remote_ip: { within: "192.0.2.1" }
    - remote_ip: { within: "192.0.2.1/24" }
    - remote_ip: { within: "::1/128" }


## `scope`

Require the current authenticated user to have a specific scope (implies `authenticated`).

    - scope: { present: acme/prod-team }


## `username`

Require the current authenticated user to have a specific username (implies `authenticated`).

    - username: { is: dpb587 }
