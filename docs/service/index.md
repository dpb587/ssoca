# Services

Services provide the client+server bindings between `ssoca` and the certificate, identity, or user service providers. The following services provide the user with certificate-based authentication to external services:

 * [HTTP](http)
 * [OpenVPN](openvpn)
 * [SSH](ssh)

Several meta-services provide commands and endpoints for authentication and additional resources:

 * [Authentication](auth)
 * [Document Root](docroot)
 * [Download](download)
 * [Environment](env)


## Configuration

Services require additional server-side configuration ([learn more](../server)). Configuration for services are documented on their respective service page.
