# Download (`download`)

A service to expose files from the local filesystem which can be downloaded by a client.

This service does not provide any client-side commands. Typically this would be used to enable the server to provide pre-compiled binaries of the `ssoca` client itself.


## Options

 * **`glob`** - a glob path for matching files to publish for downloads
