Features

 * Log additional request data for environments running behind proxies ([#6](https://github.com/dpb587/ssoca/issues/6)). To enable detection of proxied client IPs, you must explicitly configure your proxy server IPs or CIDRs with the `server.trusted_proxies` list.
 * Improve the [documentation site](https://dpb587.github.io/ssoca) and switch to [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Bug Fixes

 * Fix `sudo` passwords being ignored after authentication interrupts a service command ([#8](https://github.com/dpb587/ssoca/issues/8)).
