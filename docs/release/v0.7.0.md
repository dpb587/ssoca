Features

 * client can now upgrade itself from remote servers running 0.7.0+ (`ssoca-client env update-client`)
 * cleanup default browser UI for better download/configuration/usage instructions
 * embed version information in client (`ssoca-client version`)
 * the server `certauth` setting for services is now optional, defaulting to certauth named `default`
 * add Shimo and Viscosity to list of OS X paths used for finding an `openvpn` binary
 * rename `ssoca-client openvpn connect` to `ssoca-client openvpn exec` (`connect` remains as an alias for now)
 * Tunnelblick profiles are now named after environment (rather than generic `openvpn`, by default)
 * restart openvpn connections if there are frequent, repeated authentications via management service (for cases where server has rotated credentials)
 * client version is now reported in API requests for easier investigations from server logs

Fixes

 * server API now returns correct Content-Type header for JSON
 * custom auth success/failure pages now work correctly
 * improved authentication vs authorization error handling - now using HTTP 401 Unauthorized when auth tokens are invalid (previously 403 Forbidden was used; this may break automatic reauthentication attempts in older clients)

Development

 * automate builds of binaries and publishing of releases
 * continue improving test coverage
