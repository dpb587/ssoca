Features

 * show a warning message on authentication result pages if an outdated client is detected
 * easier installation of Tunnelblick profiles with the `--install` option

Bug Fixes

 * Tunnelblick re-authentication prompts should not become detached from desktop interactions (caused hanging processes)

Development

 * switch to vendoring with [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep)
 * update some vendored dependencies
 * refactor ssh client for easier imports
