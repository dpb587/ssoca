**Enhancements**

 * Rename the `download` service to `file` service to clarify it as a resource rather than an action (`download` currently remains as an alias).
 * Support using simple globs in file names with `file get`.
 * Add `file exec` command to temporarily download and then execute a file.
 * Improve interactive browser login prompts for Linux and Windows.
 * Require all server services to have at least one access requirement defined in order to avoid accidental, public services.
 * Support multiple authentication providers within a single environment.
 * Updated server configuration file format (`auth` services should now be configured in the `services` section).

**Development**

 * Significant refactoring of authentication providers.
 * Switch errors and log messages to consistently use lower case.
 * Update to go/1.12.6.
