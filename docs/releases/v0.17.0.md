**Features**

 * Rename the `download` service to `file` service to clarify it as a resource rather than an action (`download` currently remains as an alias).
 * Enable glob-style support when downloading a file with `file get`.
 * Add support for automatically installing `openvpn` if it is not found.

**Development**

 * Update to go/1.12.5.
