**Features**

 * Rename the `download` service to `file` service to clarify it as a resource rather than an action (`download` currently remains as an alias).
 * Support using simple globs in file names with `file get`.
 * Add `file exec` command to temporarily download and then execute a file.
 * Automatically try to install `openvpn` using platform package managers if it cannot be found on the system.
 * Improve interactive browser login prompts for Linux and Windows.

**Development**

 * Update to go/1.12.5.
