**Features**

 * Automatically validate the connection and CA certificate to an environment when configuring it, and show confirmation to the user
 * Automatically prefix environment URLs with `https://` if it is not already specified for slightly shorter commands
 * Show slightly more descriptive HTTP error messages when requests fail (e.g. show `403 Forbidden` instead of `403`)
 * Rename `env add` to `env set` to clarify it can be used for updating settings as well (`env add` currently remains as an alias)
 * Rename `env info` to `env services`, and add `env info` for showing the environment name, URL, and banner
 * Improved `auth info` behaviors:
   * Additional options to show only specific pieces of data (i.e. `--authenticated`, `--id`, and `--groups`)
   * Now exit with an error if the user is not authenticated
 * Improved `openvpn create-tunnelblick-profile --install` behaviors:
   * Create and secure Tunnelblick directories, if necessary, to avoid Tunnelblick needing to be installed/run beforehand
   * Preset connection profile options to: ensure automatic reconnect on certificate expiration; and avoid automatic IP change detection and prompts
   * Require Tunnelblick to not be running during install to ensure settings are applied and avoid confusion about new profiles not immediately appearing
 * Show new, updated client version confirmation after using `env update-client`

**Bug Fixes**

 * Fix `or` authorization filter to error with specific error type (avoids generic `500` internal server errors and enables automatic re-login attempts)
