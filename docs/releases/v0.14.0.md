Features

 * Log additional request data for environments running behind proxies ([#6](https://github.com/dpb587/ssoca/issues/6)). To enable detection of proxied client IPs, you must explicitly configure your proxy server IPs or CIDRs with the `server.trusted_proxies` list.
 * When executing `openvpn`, add `/usr/local/sbin` to the list of fallback paths to search ([#9](https://github.com/dpb587/ssoca/issues/9)).
 * Improve the `get` command of downloads to support sending the file to `STDOUT` after a successful download.
 * Improve CLI options handling of the `--service` flag so it can be passed next to the service rather than its subcommand.
 * Improve the [documentation site](https://dpb587.github.io/ssoca) and switch to [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
 * Configurable [`robots.txt`](https://moz.com/learn/seo/robotstxt) setting via `server.robotstxt` (defaults to disallowing all crawlers).

Bug Fixes

 * Fix `sudo` passwords being ignored after authentication interrupts a service command ([#8](https://github.com/dpb587/ssoca/issues/8)).
 * When executing Tunnelblick's `openvpn` executable on macOS, avoid using older, unsupported versions.

Development

 * Switch to [`github.com/pkg/errors`](https://github.com/pkg/errors) for internal error wrapping.
